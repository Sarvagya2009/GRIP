# From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Unsupervised clustering problem of predicting which category a specific sample belongs to based on its distance from the predicted centroid of cluster.

# Overview
Performing EDA on the iris dataset to see relationships between features and visually forming an hypothesis of what the optimal cluster number is. This is followed by using sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster cente to see where the elbow is made for cluster numbers ranging from 1 to 10. The optimal cluster is then applied to kmeans clustering algorithm and the assigned labels are represented visually.
