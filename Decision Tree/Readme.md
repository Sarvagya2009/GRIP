# Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

If we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly and visualize the nodes graphically.

# Overview
Performing EDA on the iris dataset to see relationships between features as well as target variable. Followed by creating a decision tree classifier and fit it to traning set followed by predicting randomly shuffled test data. Two python packages Graphviz and dtreeviz are used to visualize the tree in different ways. 

Datasets used: 
1. Iris dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
